"""Running something off the UI thread, once, correctly.

Every background call in Flow goes through here. The one subtlety worth
keeping in one place: QThreadPool takes ownership of the C++ runnable, but
nothing holds the Python wrapper, and a collected wrapper takes its signals
with it -- the callbacks then never fire and the UI waits forever. `run()`
keeps the worker in a set until it finishes.
