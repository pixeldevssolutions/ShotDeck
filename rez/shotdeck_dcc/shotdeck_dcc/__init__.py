"""ShotDeck's tools, running inside the DCC.

Resolving the shotdeck_dcc rez package is the entire install: it puts this
package on PYTHONPATH and wires the host's own startup mechanism, which calls

    import shotdeck_dcc
    shotdeck_dcc.install()

Artists never copy a userSetup.py, never edit PYTHONPATH, and never type a
setup command.

Which adapter loads is decided by SHOTDECK_SOFTWARE, normalised by ShotDeck at
launch. Host modules (maya.cmds, nuke, fx) are imported inside the adapter that
owns them, never at module scope, so importing this package inside Nuke cannot
drag Maya code in with it.
