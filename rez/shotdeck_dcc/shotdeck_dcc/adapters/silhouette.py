"""Silhouette adapter -- deliberately written against what is found at runtime.

The Silhouette build on the 5and8 farm has not been inspected yet, so nothing
here assumes a menu API, a module name, or a save function. `probe_silhouette.py`
in the package root prints what the installed version actually exposes; wire the
result into HOST_MODULES / SAVE_METHODS / _build_menu() once it has been run.

Until then this adapter still does useful work: the actions are importable and
callable from Silhouette's script console, and install() says exactly what it
could not find instead of failing silently or guessing.
