"""Host-specific code. One module per DCC, imported only inside that DCC.

Every adapter offers the same three things to the shared code above it:

    install()            build the Flow menu
    save_scene(path)     save the open scene to path
    message(text)        put text where this host shows messages

Two more are optional, and only matter to Deadline: frame_range() and
deadline_plugin_info(scene). A host that renders on the farm implements them;
one that does not is refused by deadline.PLUGINS long before they are called.

The menu itself is described once, in ACTIONS, so the hosts differ only in how
they build menus rather than in what is on them.
