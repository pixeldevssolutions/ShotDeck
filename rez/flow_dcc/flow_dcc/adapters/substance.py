"""Substance 3D Painter adapter.

Painter's plugin API can only add actions to the menus it already has -- there
is no API for a menu of its own -- so the Flow actions go under File,
prefixed with the menu name so they read as one group.

Painter ships PySide6 from 2024 and PySide2 before it, and QAction moved
between QtWidgets and QtGui in that jump; _qt() covers both rather than
pinning the package to one Painter release.
