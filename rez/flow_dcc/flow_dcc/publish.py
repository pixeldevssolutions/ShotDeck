"""Publishing a scene from inside the DCC.

The pipeline, in order:

    read context -> validate -> determine workfile -> determine version
      -> determine publish destination -> save/version the scene
      -> create the publish -> validate the published file
      -> register in ShotGrid -> report

Two rules shape the error handling. Everything before the save is a *check* --
it fails cheaply, changes nothing, and says why. Everything from the save
onward has already touched the disk, so a later failure reports what was
written rather than pretending the publish did not happen: a scene published
on disk but unregistered in ShotGrid is a bookkeeping problem, and telling the
artist their publish failed would be a lie that costs them the work.

Scope note: this publishes the *scene file*. Media publishing -- preflight,
media inspection, upload, notes -- stays in Flow's publish dialog, which
already owns it.

Security note: registration authenticates with SG_SCRIPT_KEY, which reaches
the DCC only because launcher.py builds the launch environment from
os.environ. It is deliberately not part of the FLOW_* context. Anything
running in the DCC can read it -- worth knowing before widening what the key
is allowed to do.
