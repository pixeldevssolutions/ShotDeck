"""Submitting the open scene to Deadline, from inside the DCC.

One submitter for every host, because Deadline's own interface is the same for
all of them: two plain text files -- a job info file and a plugin info file --
handed to `deadlinecommand`. Nothing here imports Deadline's Python API, so no
DCC needs Deadline's submitter scripts on its path and nothing has to be
rewritten when the farm upgrades.

What is genuinely per-host is small. It lives in PLUGINS below, plus two
optional hooks an adapter may implement:

    frame_range()             (first, last) for the open scene
    deadline_plugin_info()    plugin keys only that host knows -- Houdini's
                              ROP, Nuke's write node, Maya's project path

The submitted scene is the work file on /jobs, never a copy in the repository:
the farm mounts the same storage the artist does, and a job that renders a
snapshot nobody can find again is worse than no job.

Failure is loud and early. Everything here happens before a frame is rendered,
so there is nothing to half-finish -- either Deadline accepted the job and
returned an id, or the artist is told exactly what to fix.
