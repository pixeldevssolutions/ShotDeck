"""Hand Versions to OpenRV, the studio's review player.

Flow's built-in QMediaPlayer is fine for a glance at a preview movie, but it
cannot play an EXR sequence, has no colour management, and has no compare. RV
does all three, and it is already on the farm as a rez package:

    /software/packages/dcc/openrv/3.1.0/platform-linux/os-rocky-9.6/bin/rv

so it is launched the same way every other DCC here is -- `rez env openrv -- rv`
-- rather than by pointing at rv.bin, which skips the wrapper that sets RV_HOME
and the OCIO config with it.

Two things have to be taken off the environment first. RV ships its own Qt and
its own Python, and Flow is a PySide6 app whose process environment names
Flow's copies of both; a PyInstaller build makes that worse by putting its
bundled libraries on LD_LIBRARY_PATH. RV notices one of them itself --

    warning: QT_PLUGIN_PATH is set, which can cause RV to load the wrong Qt
    libraries/plugins.  Unsetting...

-- but not the rest, so they are stripped here. See HOSTILE_VARS.
