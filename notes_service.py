"""Production notes on a Version, as ShotGrid models them.

ShotGrid's shape is a Note with Replies hanging off it -- one level, not an
arbitrary tree. That is the native representation and this follows it rather
than inventing nesting ShotGrid cannot store: a reply to a reply is a reply to
the same note, shown under the message it answers. Nothing is kept locally.
ShotGrid is the source of truth for every note, author and timestamp here.

No Qt: the browser renders threads, it does not build them.

Every write goes through the one ShotGrid script user, so the author is not
something ShotGrid can tell apart. Flow signs each note's text with the AD
login instead -- "Jitesh: Fixed the edge" -- and reads that back as the author.
Notes signed the earlier way, "[jitesh] Fixed the edge", still read back.
